# Exercise 1

Firstly, we identified the different parts of the problem which were:

1. Printing the list
2. Adding a new task
3. Removing an existing task
4. Exiting the script

We created functions for each of this and combined it together with a main user interface that displays the different types of options available to the user.
Based on the selected option, the corresponding function is called.


# Exercise 2

To begin with, we create a function that counts the number of lines in a file.
The user is asked to insert a path for a directory and that path is checked to confirm it in fact exist.
If it does exist, the directory is looped through and each file in it is checked and the number of lines it has is returned.
Else if the directory doesn't exist, a feedback message is given to the user to express this information.
